# Versioning

For all long lived Planetary Software projects we have adopted the semantic
versioning specification ([meeting notes](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/blob/master/Meetings/2018-12-18.md)). See [https://semver.org](https://semver.org) for the specification for semantic versioning.
