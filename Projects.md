# Planetary Software Organization Top-Level Projects

Planetary Software Organization Top-Level Projects (TLPs) are
autonomous projects created and managed by their own Technical
Committees (TC), not the Planetary Software Technical Steering
Committee (TSC).

These are primarily software projects of various kinds which already
exist separately.  They benefit from being Planetary Software TLPs
in the following ways: 

1. The TSC helps them adopt or formalize governance and
	community standards to foster their existance as an open
	source community.
2. They gain the ability to easily reach out to the Planetary
	Software TSC for consultation or mentorship on technical
	or governance issues, and have the option to serve on the
	Planetary Software TSC.
3. Being recognized as a Planetary Software TLP lets others
	know that their project conforms to community best practices
	which are likely to result in long-term success for their
	project.

Groups can submit applications for their project to become a TLP
at any time but must go through the TLP [lifecycle process](Lifecycle.md)
and be approved by the TSC.  The TSC never takes responsibility or 
any kind of ownership of the project. The TSC approves the submitted
charter and governance documents, and works with the newly-certified
TLP's TC as much or as little as the TC desires.  As long as the TC
continues to operate their project in a way that conforms with the
TSC's values and requirements, it will continue to be a chartered 
Planetary Software TLP.

TLPs are not typically formed to *begin* a set of tasks but instead
are transformed from existing projects where work is already underway
and the contributors think it would benefit from formalizing an
open source governance model, benefiting from TSC consultation, and/or 
participating in TSC activities.

That being said, the work need not be great, nor the contributors many,
nor the commit history long to benefit from being a Planetary Software
TLP.

## Joining a TLP

To find out how to join a TLP, consult its Charter or
Contributing document in the TLP's repository.

## Starting a Top Level Project

To submit a project as a TLP or start a TLP, become familiar with the
[lifecycle of a TLP][lifecycle], and read through the [example
documents](Bootstrap-Policies/) to get started.
