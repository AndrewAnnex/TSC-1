The documents in this directory are meant to be used as templates
to bootstrap the documents needed to start a new Planetary Software
Top-Level Project (TLP) or Top-Level Working Group (TLWG).

Please read the [Lifecycle Document][lifecycle] for more 
information.

## Establishing a new TLP or TLWG

In general, your process will be as follows:

	1. Have an effort that would benefit from being a TLP or a TLWG
	2. Find some like-minded individuals <a id="folks"></a>
	3. Copy the relevant documents from this directory 
		and modify as needed for your TLP or TLWG
	4. Submit an application for your TLP or TLWG to enter TSC 
		Incubation (this can be done in parallel with #3)
	5. The TSC will work with you to get your application accepted
		into Incubation
	6. The TSC will work with you to get your project or working
		group out of Incubation
	7. Then your endeavor will be a Planetary Software Top-Level Project
		or a Planetary Software Top-Level Working Group, congrats!

Whether you use these example documents or not, the most important
thing for your nascent TLP or TLWG is to establish a charter.  A
charter is a *statement of purpose*, a *list of responsibilities*,
and a *list of initial membership*.

### Statement of Purpose

What is the goal of your TLP or TLWG?


### List of Responsibilities

The list of responsibilities should be specific. Once established,
these responsibilities should not change, and therefore should not
be broad or subjective. 

If the responsibilities described in the draft charter are currently
undertaken by another Planetary Software TLP or TLWG, then a
discussion is required between the existing entity and your new
TLP or TLWG.  The result will either be that you will
remove that responsibility from your list, or the existing entity
will alter their charter to accomodate the change of responsibility.


### List of Initial Membership

Those like-minded individuals referenced in [Item #2 above](#folks) are 
referred to as the Tehcnical Committee (TC) for the TLP or are the members
of the TLWG.

A TC or WG should have at least 3 initial members to start the work and
get the application submitted to the Planetary Software TSC, but
it could be fewer.  It will need 3 members in order to graduate
from Incubation. These should be individuals already undertaking
the work described in the charter.

Are you concerned about being able to get 3 people?  If your
application is accepted into Incubation, the Planetary Software TSC
will help you find a strategy for growing your TC to the needed
size.


### Base Policies for new Working Groups

Once your TC or WG ratifies a charter (whether you used the [Charter
Template] in this directory or created your own), you could go
straight to writing your application to the Planetary Software
Organization.

However, to get out of Incubation, you will also need to establish
some other documents, like the ones in this directory, so you could
also work on them now.

As the templates indicate, your TLP or TLWG can just choose to
directly inherit the policies of the Planetary Software TSC.  Your
TC or WG is also free to change these documents through their own governance
process, but should retain at least the spirit of the original
versions. The template documents provided in this directory are
provided to help bootstrap that process.


## Applying to the Planetary Software Organization

You can submit your TLP or TLWG application by following the directions
for applying in the [Lifecycle Document][lifecycle].


## Miscellaneous

For software TLPs, a versioning policy is required, and we suggest
adopting the [Semantic Versioning policy](https://semver.org).
