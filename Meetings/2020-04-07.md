## Agenda / Notes

* Update Contributing guide with patch branch cleanup policy
  * Any pull request creates a patch branch. MA suggests that whoever merges also deletes the patch branch.
  * Could this create any problems or is it fine, as GH allows branch restore if needed?
  * This also is currently inherited by ISIS_TC until they have their own Contributing guide.
